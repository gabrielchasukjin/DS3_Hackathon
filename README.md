## Our Thesis

Predicting salaries can be a powerful tool at hand, as it may play an important role for Federal Governors who determine inflation rates and control the economy from going south. This being the case, itâ€™s imperative to have a precise and trustable model that accurately predicts oneâ€™s salary. We developed this report to build a model that appropriately predicts people's salaries.

ðŸ’¡ However, oneâ€™s salary isnâ€™t simply determined by a single factor, but by multiple conditions/variables that all influence how much money ðŸ’µ an individual makes.

</aside>

Therefore, we compiled the 50,000+ data points, cleansed away missing values, and took a **multiple regression** approach to predict oneâ€™s salary.
